# Wireless Kinesis Advantage BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

Turns the [Kinesis Advantage Keyboard](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/) keyboard into a wireless BLE keyboard with a few extra features. Built with Adafruit's nRF52 Feather Arduino boards.

For instructions, see the **[wiki](https://github.com/sysdevmike/KinesisBLE/wiki)**. For more details on the build check out the **[project](https://hackaday.io/project/161578-wireless-ble-kinesis-advantage-custom-controller)**.


## Many thanks to

- [Yin Zhong](https://summivox.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/keyboard-matrix-scanning-and-debouncing/) - Explains a better way to handle debouncing.
- [Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2018-04-17-kinx-keyboard-controller/) - Double mention as I ported his debouncing used in his KinX controller to Matt's firmware.
- [Matt Vilim](https://github.com/mattvilim/FeatherCtrl) - New firmware is a fork of his FeatherCtrl project.
- [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406) - Great documentation, libs and support.
- [afriggeri](https://github.com/afriggeri/kb) - The original firmware borrowed heavily from his [Blanck Keyboard](https://medium.com/@friggeri/the-blanck-keyboard-24afe12e81a) project.
- [Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.de/posts/2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller/) - Michael Stapelberg's custom controller inspired this project. His PCB routing was also very inspirational.
- [Humble Hacker](http://humblehacker.com/blog/20100720/hacking-the-kinesis-contoured-keyboard/) - Detailed write-up helped me understand the keyboard matrix.
- [PCBgogo](http://www.pcbgogo.com) - All the boards were made by these guys. Fast turn-around.
